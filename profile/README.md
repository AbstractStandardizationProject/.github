# Welcome to the Standardization Project!

What is currently known as the Abstract Standardization Project (The ASP, for short) is an effort to bring about thought-out and logical standards to projects all around the world. 

Anywhere from artistic studies to research and engineering. The ASP wishes to set solid bases that any project can follow through without sacrificing freedom or creativity.

## Current State of the Project
The project is currently in very early development and is still structuring itself.
While not actively looking for members, the organization expects to amass a large userbase and allow the world to contibute in its high-quality standards.

## Origin
The founder of the Project, aliased Ayimany Mooncat, started the project due to failing to see solid standards in many of projects they've participated in,
ranging from common team tasks to robotics teams and research projects. 

Due to this, they set out to create this organization in order to guide people on solid foundations regarding the structure of their projects
by means of simple, easy-to-understand standards while adhering to the precision and strictness of experts in their area of study.

The official birthdate of the ASP is the 21st of August, 2024, 00:00 a.m. Â± 1s GMT-6 (Exact First Publication Date).
This document is the first written rendition of Mooncat's ideas and as such, it is the cornerstone of the ASP's birth.
